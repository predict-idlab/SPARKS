<span class="markdown">The Sparks Upper Ontology serves as an upper ontology for organizing and interrelating key concepts within the realm of Industry 4.0. It facilitates the seamless integration of disparate elements such as sensor systems, anomaly detection, maintenance procedures, and process definitions, enabling a holistic understanding and management of industrial processes. At its core, Sparks emphasizes the interconnectedness of various domains within Industry 4.0, recognizing that sensor data informs system behavior, which in turn influences procedural outcomes. By representing these relationships explicitly, Sparks enables organizations to efficiently manage data, detect anomalies, and execute maintenance procedures in a coherent and systematic manner.
